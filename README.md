On clicking this open a popup and load all the contacts (from the dummy data.json/js file).
On clicking the contact should start a new conversation (if no conversation was previously started). Or open the existing conversation for that contact.
Right side view

Send a message in the conversation
Handle errors and success alerts and show appropriate alerts/Notifications.
